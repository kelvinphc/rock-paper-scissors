Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors game! This game is played entirely in the console.

At the start of each round, you will input your choice of either rock, paper or scissors. The input is case insensitive.

The game will generate a choice for the Computer. A message will be displayed to show who won the round. The tallied score for the round will also be displayed.

First to 3 wins!
